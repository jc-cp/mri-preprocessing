When performing the registration step for MRI (pediatric) brain images, please access the NIHPD template website for brain volumes from the 4.5 to 18.5y age range (https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/software/tools-data-analysis/anatomical-mri/atlases/nihpd). The download files can be accessed here (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~vfonov/nihpd/obj1/). Please include /copy the dowloaded templates to this "/mri-preprocessing/data/registration_templates/" folder if you want to enable the registration setp. You can copy the whole folder here and remind to use the templates that contain asym and nifti in their description! Then you can proceed to load the sequence that you want to use in the config.json by selecting the individual file. The best if you include this path to the .gitignore to not add the files to the repository.
